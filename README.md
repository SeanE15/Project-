# <p align="center"> Pands Project - Iris Fisher Data Set
---
This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it.

According to 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris':

"This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. ... The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other." 

The information that is included in the data set is as follows:
1) Sepal length in cm 
2) Sepal width in cm 
3) Petal length in cm 
4) Petal width in cm 
5) Class of flower: A) Iris Setosa, B) Iris Versicolour and C) Iris Virginica


**<p align="center"> Analysis of Results**

From what we can see from the dataset above - when passed through the program that I have written it has produces a range of results about the 3 species of Iris.
When comparing Sepal Length the Iris Virginica had some of the larger varieties found on the particular day that the information was collected. However the general 
sepal length of the 3 species seems to be, on average, fairly consistent (with a few irregularities here and there.) Generally in Sepal Length the majority of Iris' measured 
came between 5cm and 7cm in length, with the mean measurement coming in at 5.84cm. The same could be said for Sepal Width, with the majority of flowers coming in between 2.5cm and 3.5cm with the mean measurement being 3.05cm.

Petal Length and Width provide much starker sets of information. Iris Setosa's petal sizes, both in width and length were dwarfed by the other two species - with petal length of between 1cm and 2cm - with the average being 1.5cm and the average petal width being between 0.1cm and 0.5cm. According to the dataset provided the Iris Versicolor has longer petals starting at 3cm and finishing just over 5cm in length - with the average being 4.00cm. The petal width measurements were between 1.0cm and 1.75cm respectively in the Iris Versicolor, with an average measurement of 1.375cm.

According to the dataset the Iris Virginica has much longer and wider petals than the other two species - the average petal length ranged between 5cm and 7cm with the average being 6cm, while the petal width went from 1.5cm to 2.5cm - with the average being 2cm in width. Compared to the setosa the Virginica also has longer sepal length from 5.5cm to 8cm in length. The Sepal width in the Virginica was also fairly average - spanning from 2.5cm to 3.75cm in width with the average reading being 3.0cm.
