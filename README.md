# <p align="center"> Pands Project - Iris Fisher Data Set
---
This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it.

According to 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris':

"This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. ... The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other." 

The information that is included in the data set is as follows:
1) Sepal length in cm 
2) Sepal width in cm 
3) Petal length in cm 
4) Petal width in cm 
5) Class of flower: A) Iris Setosa, B) Iris Versicolour and C) Iris Virginica
